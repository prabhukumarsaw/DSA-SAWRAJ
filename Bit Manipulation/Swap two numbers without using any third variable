Swap two numbers without using any third variable

This is again one of the simplest and most commonly used bit hacks. The idea is to use XOR operators to swap two numbers by their property x ^ x = 0.

The following C++ program demonstrates it:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
void swap(int &x, int &y)
{
    if (x != y)
    {
        x = x ^ y;
        y = x ^ y;
        x = x ^ y;
    }
}
 
int main()
{
    int x = 3, y = 4;
 
    cout << "Before swap: x = " << x << " and y = " << y;
    swap(x, y);
    cout << "\nAfter swap: x = " << x << " and y = " << y;
 
    return 0;
}
