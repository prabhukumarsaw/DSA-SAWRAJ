Add 1 to an integer

The expression -~x will add 1 to an integer x. We know that to get negative of a number, invert its bits and add 1 to it (Remember negative numbers are stored in 2â€™s complement form), i.e.,

-x = ~x + 1;
-~x = x + 1 (by replacing x by ~x)


CODE::

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    int x = 4;
    cout << x << " + " << 1 << " is " << -~x << endl;
 
    x = -5;
    cout << x << " + " << 1 << " is " << -~x << endl;
 
    x = 0;
    cout << x << " + " << 1 << " is " << -~x << endl;
 
    return 0;
}
